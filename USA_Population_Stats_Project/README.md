This project's purpose is to get an understanding and idea about different statistical trends from the data on the US population depending on a state. Data analysed and plotted: median household income, share that voted for Trump, average annual crime rate per 100k, share of the population that is unemployed (seasonally adjusted) and share of the population that has a highshool degree. Python was used for this particular project.
